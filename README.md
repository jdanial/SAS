# SAS
SAS is the Stoichiometry Analysis Software. This software was developed for high order subunit counting of biomolecular complexes at the single molecule level acquired using wide-field diffraction-limited microscopy. 
## Installation
To install SAS, you will need to install MATLAB 2020a or higher. This version of MATLAB can be downloaded from [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). Once installed, the following four packages must be installed: signal processing and communications; machine learning and deep learning; maths, statistics and optimization; image processing and computer vision. Clone this directory in a folder of your choice on your computer.
## Operation
To operate SAS, double-click the file named `SAS_vx.mlapp`. The software will load and a GUI will appear.   
In the `Data path` panel, press the `Select path` button and a dialog will appear. Browse to the folder containing your data. See below for how to format your data for processing using SAS.  
In the `Detection parameters` panel, flip the `Detect` switch to the `Y` position.
